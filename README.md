A simple example on Image Classification in Node.js with TensorFlow.js

#### Check out the [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@happytejasrathod/image-classification-machine-learning-in-node-js-with-tensorflow-js-dd8e20ba5024) for detailed explanation.


## Installation

Open it in GitHub Desktop or git clone the repository or download the zip & extract the project.

Open the terminal in the project folder and type `npm install`.

## Testing

Go to the project folder, and Open the Terminal to that path.

Two images are already added in the repository. You can use any image you have, just paste it in the project folder and give the name as the argument.

<img src="https://github.com/deepjyotiroy079/node-image-classifier/blob/master/dog.jpg" height="400" width="360">

- Run the file **_(app.js)_** with an image file as an argument.

```
node app.js dog.jpg
```

- The result will be shown in the Terminal as :
```
Classification Resultes : [
  { className: 'Siberian husky', probability: 0.6279147267341614 },
  { className: 'Eskimo dog, husky', probability: 0.35996127128601074 },
  {
    className: 'malamute, malemute, Alaskan malamute',
    probability: 0.0116340396925807
  }
]

```
